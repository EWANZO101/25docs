            <p class="mb-4">Dear valued users,</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This is to inform you about an upcoming maintenance scheduled for <span class="font-semibold">Tuesday, March 4, 2025</span>. 
                Our services will be unavailable from <span class="font-semibold">10:00 AM GMT</span> until <span class="font-semibold">6:00 PM GMT</span>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The reason for this downtime is due to us relocating our servers to a different location. This process involves 
                time for transportation and setup. We are letting you know well in advance in the hopes of minimizing disruption 
                to your services or playtime.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We understand that this may cause frustration, but please know that this relocation is for the benefit of our 
                service. After this move, we aim to provide a more stable and reliable service compared to last year.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                If you have any questions or concerns, please open a ticket in our <span class="font-semibold">#openticket</span> channel on Discord:

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-center mb-4">What This Means for Your Services</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                As we try our best to minimize disruption, we expect everything to be resolved and set up by <span class="font-semibold">6:00 PM GMT</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Most of our customers are based in the USA, so this should not affect you unless you have morning RPS (Roleplays) or use your service in the morning of the 4th.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                However, please note that if you have a VPS, <span class="font-semibold text-red-400">your IP address will change</span>. 
                All users on <span class="font-semibold">N4-Scotland</span> should take note of this.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For our Snaily CAD users, your services should be restored within minutes of our equipment being connected. This applies to the <span class="font-semibold">N1-Scotland</span> server.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We hope for a smooth and quick transfer, but please understand that there might be minor hiccups. 
                We will do our best to keep any disruptions to a minimum.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-center text-yellow-400">
                Thank you for your patience and understanding.
