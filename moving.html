            <p class="mb-4">Dear valued users,</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This is to inform you about an upcoming maintenance scheduled for <span class="font-semibold">Tuesday, March 4, 2025</span>. 
                Our services will be unavailable from <span class="font-semibold">10:00 AM GMT</span> until <span class="font-semibold">6:00 PM GMT</span>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The reason for this downtime is due to us relocating our servers to a different location. This process involves 
                time for transportation and setup. We are letting you know well in advance in the hopes of minimizing disruption 
                to your services or playtime.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We understand that this may cause frustration, but please know that this relocation is for the benefit of our 
                service. After this move, we aim to provide a more stable and reliable service compared to last year.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
