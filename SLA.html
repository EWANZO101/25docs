                        Swift Peak Hosting offers essential DDoS protection to defend against a variety of common network attacks. Our mitigation strategy is designed to help safeguard against smaller, unsophisticated DDoS incidents, leveraging robust network-level filtering and traffic inspection techniques.

                        <li><strong>Traffic Filtering:</strong> Network-level traffic inspection is employed to identify and block malicious patterns, mitigating smaller-scale attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention:</strong> Our infrastructure includes advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify and respond to potential DDoS threats in real-time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> We implement rate limiting and traffic throttling to reduce the impact of high-traffic volume spikes, ensuring legitimate users experience minimal disruption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom Firewall Rules:</strong> Clients can configure firewall rules to restrict suspicious or known malicious IPs and control traffic flow, minimizing exposure to potential DDoS risks.</li>

                        While Swift Peak Hosting’s DDoS protection provides a solid defense against smaller and targeted attacks, it may not be sufficient for handling large-scale volumetric DDoS attacks or application layer (Layer 7) threats. For comprehensive DDoS protection against high-bandwidth attacks, we recommend utilizing dedicated cloud-based DDoS mitigation services from leading providers such as Cloudflare, AWS Shield, Akamai, or services provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

                        Swift Peak Hosting’s DDoS protection offers effective mitigation for low to moderate-level attacks. For more advanced, large-scale threats, clients are encouraged to utilize third-party specialized DDoS protection solutions to ensure optimal service availability and security.
