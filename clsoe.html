            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">
                We regret to inform you that <strong>Swift Peak Hosting LTD</strong> will be shutting down. Due to several factors, including <strong>ongoing health issues, network challenges, and financial difficulties</strong>, we have made the difficult decision to close our services.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">
                For those with data on a <strong>VPS or SnailyCAD</strong>, we will <strong>reopen services for 10 days in April</strong> to allow you to access and retrieve your data. The exact date will be announced soon, so please stay tuned for further updates.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">
                We understand this may be frustrating, and we apologize for any inconvenience. To assist with your transition, we will reach out to resources to help you <strong>find an alternative VPS or SnailyCAD solution</strong> that fits your needs.
